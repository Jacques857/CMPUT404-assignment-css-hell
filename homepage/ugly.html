                        The vast majority of my career has been spent as the top laner for Fnatic in Europe. During my time there we won 7 regional titles and made 2 appearances at the World Championship. While I was on Fnatic, we were always one of the top competitors in the European scene. While most of my career has been in the top lane, I have played bot lane as well as jungle for Fnatic. I believe that by practicing other roles, I can achieve a deeper understanding of the game and improve as a more well rounded top laner.

                        This is my favorite off-meta pocket pick. I have surprised many top level players with this pick.

                        This pick is one of my most practiced and reliable options. It has been a pick that has allowed me to carry effectively from the top lane.

                        This is a pick that I've used to blow the minds of my opponents in the bot lane. No one expects the early damage from this underrated champion.
