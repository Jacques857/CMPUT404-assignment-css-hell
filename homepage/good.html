                    I am a highly vocal player both in game and out. Not only do I shotcall for my team, but I am not afraid to voice my sometimes controversial opinions on the state of the game and what strategies are effective.

                    I have been the starting top laner for Team Liquid since November, 2021. We compete in the North American League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) and aim to qualify for the World Championship this summer.

                    The vast majority of my career has been spent as the top laner for Fnatic in Europe. During my time there we won 7 regional titles and made 2 appearances at the World Championship. While I was on Fnatic, we were always one of the top competitors in the European scene. While most of my career has been in the top lane, I have played bot lane as well as jungle for Fnatic. I believe that by practicing other roles, I can achieve a deeper understanding of the game and improve as a more well rounded top laner.

                    This pick is one of my most practiced and reliable options. It has been a pick that has allowed me to carry effectively from the top lane.

                    This is a pick that I've used to blow the minds of my opponents in the bot lane. No one expects the early damage from this underrated champion.
